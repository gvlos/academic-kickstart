abstract: "Searching for new physics, i.e., physical laws that go beyond the reference models,
is the absolute priority of the field. In this thesis, a novel machine learning approach
for model-independent new physics searches is presented, based on the work by
D’Agnolo and Wulzer, 2019. The core algorithm of our proposal is powered by recent
large scale implementations of kernel methods, non-parametric models that can
approximate any continuous function given enough data. The model evaluates the
compatibility between experimental data and a reference model, by implementing
a hypothesis testing procedure based on the likelihood ratio. Model-independence
is enforced by avoiding any prior assumption about the presence or shape of new
physics components in the measurements. We show that our solution has dramatic
advantages compared to neural network implementations in terms of training times
and computational resources, while maintaining comparable performances. Our algorithm
has been tested on High Energy Physics datasets of increasing dimensionality."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: A novel algorithm for the detection of dorsal fins is presented in the context of a fully automated pipeline for the photo-identification of Risso’s dolphins. A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is proposed to recognize fins among cropped images, filtering the inputs for the photo-identification algorithm.
