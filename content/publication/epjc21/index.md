abstract: "We present a machine learning approach for model-independent new physics searches.
The corresponding algorithm is powered by recent large-scale implementations of kernel
methods, nonparametric learning algorithms that can approximate any continuous function
given enough data. Based on the original proposal by D’Agnolo and Wulzer [1], the model
evaluates the compatibility between experimental data and a reference model, by implementing a hypothesis testing procedure based on the likelihood ratio. Model-independence
is enforced by avoiding any prior assumption about the presence or shape of new physics
components in the measurements. We show that our approach has dramatic advantages
compared to neural network implementations in terms of training times and computational
resources, while maintaining comparable performances. In particular, we conduct our tests
on higher dimensional datasets, a step forward with respect to previous studies."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: A novel algorithm for the detection of dorsal fins is presented in the context of a fully automated pipeline for the photo-identification of Risso’s dolphins. A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is proposed to recognize fins among cropped images, filtering the inputs for the photo-identification algorithm.
