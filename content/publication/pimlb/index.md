# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: A novel algorithm for the detection of dorsal fins is presented in the context of a fully automated pipeline for the photo-identification of Rissoâ€™s dolphins. A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is proposed to recognize fins among cropped images, filtering the inputs for the photo-identification algorithm.
