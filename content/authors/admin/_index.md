I am a Master Student in Computer Science at [University of Genoa](https://unige.it/en/), pursuing the special track titled Data Science & Engineering - Artificial Intelligence. My greatest ambition is to work on science and engineering of intelligence. I am especially attracted by the incredibly powerful mix of machine learning and neuroscience. My research interests are focused on [recent advances](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-brain-maps-out-ideas-and-memories-like-spaces-20190114/) in cognition models based on grid cells. I am also interested in understanding how to design explainable and sustainable machine learning algorithms.

Currently, I am studying machine learning methods applied to high energy physics under the supervision of [Prof. Lorenzo Rosasco](http://web.mit.edu/lrosasco/www/) at the [Laboratory for Computational and Statistical Learning](http://lcsl.mit.edu/#/home), part of the [Machine Learning Genoa center](https://ml.unige.it/). I am also fellow of [IANUA](http://www.ianua.unige.it/), the excellence school of University of Genoa. Previously, I obtained a BSc in Computer Science and Automation Engineering from [Polytechnic University of Bari](http://www.en.poliba.it/). For my Bachelor thesis I worked on deep learning and computer vision as an intern at the [National Research Council of Italy](https://www.stiima.cnr.it/en/index.php?sez=9), where my supervisor was [Dr. Vito Ren√≤](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=K4zb2Q4AAAAJ&hl=it).
