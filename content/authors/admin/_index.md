Hi! I am 28 and have been into AI research for 6+ years now. 
I am currently a PhD student at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/), working on reinforcement learning in the [RL3 lab](https://rl.airlab.deib.polimi.it/). My supervisor is [Marcello Restelli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xdgxRiEAAAAJ&hl=en). My research is funded by the [AI4REALNET](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101119527) project.
<!-- I am now a first-year PhD student inside the : using RL to improve electricity and railway networks, air traffic control. -->
<!-- My research ambition is to use deep reinforcement learning to address fundamental questions in cognitive neuroscience and develop smarter artificial intelligence algorithms. -->

Previously, I was at the [Machine Learning Genoa Center](https://malga.unige.it/) in the group of [Lorenzo Rosasco](http://web.mit.edu/lrosasco/www/) and lately [Agnese Seminara](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OKTmpMQAAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao). During formative years I interned at [CERN](https://home.cern/) and at the [National Research Council of Italy](https://www.stiima.cnr.it/en/index.php?sez=9).

:brain: Intelligence :brain: is my favourite scientific problem!
<!-- :brain: Intelligence :brain: to me is strictly connected to language and evolution. I am working on a formal theory out of this idea. Reach out if you are interested, I am looking for collaborators!-->

<!-- Check out this recent [conversation](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/malga-machine-learning-genoa-center_facultyspotlight-physics-ai-activity-7048632972110880768-3oEk). -->

<!-- Check out my notes ([short](https://gvlosapio.netlify.app/files/Intelligence_in_one_page.pdf) or [long](https://gvlosapio.netlify.app/files/cms_eng.pdf) version) and have a look at [Humanity](https://gvlosapio.netlify.app/files/Humanity_mod.pdf) and [RLBrain](https://gvlosapio.netlify.app/files/RLBrain.pdf). I recently published a special [interview](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/malga-machine-learning-genoa-center_facultyspotlight-physics-ai-activity-7048632972110880768-3oEk). -->

<!--I really enjoy discussing most pressing questions in science and technology.-->
