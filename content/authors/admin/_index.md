Hi! I am currently part of the [RL lab](https://rl.airlab.deib.polimi.it/) at Politecnico di Milano, working on distributed reinforcement learning for industrial production plants. My supervisor is [Marcello Restelli](https://restelli.faculty.polimi.it/MyWebSite/index.shtml).

<!-- My research ambition is to use deep reinforcement learning to address fundamental questions in cognitive neuroscience and develop smarter artificial intelligence algorithms. -->

Previously, I worked with [Lorenzo Rosasco](http://web.mit.edu/lrosasco/www/) and [Agnese Seminara](http://www3.dicca.unige.it/aseminara/) at the [Machine Learning Genoa Center](https://malga.unige.it/).

During Graduate School I was Summer Student at [CERN](https://home.cern/), working with [Thomas Owen James](https://gitlab.cern.ch/tjames) and [Emilio Meschi](http://meschi.web.cern.ch/meschi/). I also interned at the [National Research Council of Italy](https://www.stiima.cnr.it/en/index.php?sez=9), working with [Vito Ren√≤](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=K4zb2Q4AAAAJ&hl=it) and [Rosalia Maglietta](https://publications.cnr.it/authors/rosalia.maglietta).
