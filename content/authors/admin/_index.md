I am a Master Student in Computer Science - track Data Science & Engineering, Artificial Intelligence - at [University of Genoa](https://courses.unige.it/10852). My greatest ambition is contributing to the efforts currently being made to understand how our brain works. I believe that the powerful alliance between machine learning and neuroscience may lead us toward a grand, unified theory of intelligence. What intrigue me the most are closed-loop [neuromorphic systems](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/institute/people?uname=giacomo) able to learn as well as [cognition models](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-brain-maps-out-ideas-and-memories-like-spaces-20190114/) based on grid cells. I am also interested in the design of explainable and sustainable machine learning algorithms for more general applications.

Currently, I am studying machine learning methods applied to high energy physics under the supervision of [Prof. Lorenzo Rosasco](http://web.mit.edu/lrosasco/www/) at the [Laboratory for Computational and Statistical Learning](http://lcsl.mit.edu/#/home), part of the [Machine Learning Genoa center](https://ml.unige.it/). I am also fellow at [IANUA](http://www.ianua.unige.it/), the excellence school of University of Genoa. Previously, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Automation Engineering from [Polytechnic University of Bari](http://www.en.poliba.it/). For my thesis I worked on deep learning and computer vision during an internship at the [National Research Council of Italy](https://www.stiima.cnr.it/en/index.php?sez=9), where my supervisor was [Dr. Vito Ren√≤](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=K4zb2Q4AAAAJ&hl=it).
